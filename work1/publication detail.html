   <p class="story">Everyone is afraid of Xan the witch. They keep her at bay by sacrificing one baby a year to her. Xan is a good witch though, nourishing the babies with starlight before sending them off to good homes.

    Until one day, when she makes an honest mistake. She accidentally feeds a baby with moonlight instead of starlight, and so decides to raise this girl, Luna, on her own. When Luna turns 13, magic of her own emerges — with dire consequences.
    
    This coming-of-age story is a New York Times Bestseller and has won numerous awards. Your 12-year-old will love the twists and Luna’s growth in power.</p><br>
